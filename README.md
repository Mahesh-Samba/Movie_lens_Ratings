"Predictions on Movie Ratings"
In my project on predicting movie ratings using logistic regression, I integrated three datasets: user_data (comprising User_ID, Gender, Occupation, Zip code), Movies_data (with Movie_ID, Title, Genre), and Ratings_dataset (including user_id, ratings, movie_id, time_stamp). Merging these datasets enabled comprehensive analysis and feature engineering essential for accurate predictions.

The initial phase involved extensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables like Gender and Occupation. Feature engineering was crucial, where I created new features such as user demographics, movie genres, and temporal factors from the timestamp.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided valuable insights into user preferences and viewing habits. I visualized distributions of ratings across genres and demographic groups, identifying trends and correlations. This step helped in understanding which movie genres are more popular among different demographics.

Using logistic regression, a suitable choice for binary classification tasks like predicting ratings, I trained the model on the engineered features. The goal was to predict whether a user would rate a movie positively or negatively based on the features extracted from the merged dataset.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model's performance. Cross-validation techniques ensured robustness and generalization of the model across different subsets of the data.

After model training and evaluation, predictions were made on unseen data to validate its effectiveness. Insights gained from the project can guide personalized movie recommendations and inform strategic decisions in the entertainment industry, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

In conclusion, leveraging logistic regression for movie rating predictions involved a comprehensive approach integrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The project demonstrated the applicability of machine learning in understanding and predicting user preferences in the context of movie ratings.
